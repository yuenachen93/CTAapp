# CTAapp
##### The project imports the train information such as station name, location, lines, from the Chicago transit Authority(the information is in the excel file labeled as CTAStops.csv) to the Eclipse and converts to useful information that can be used in multiple purposes. The menu options are below:

-	Check information for a station: The system will return all the information including name, location, color of the lines, wheelchair accessibility, etc.
-	How to get a station: The system will ask users for the start pointing and ending point and generate a route to get to the destination.
-	Add a new station: Users can add a station into the current system
-	Delete a route: Users can delete a station from the current system
-	Display nearest station: Users can insert their current latitude and longitude to get closest station.
-	Exit: Users can exit the menu options
